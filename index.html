		<h2>About Me</h2>

	<h2>My Hobbies & Passions</h2>
<h3>🌍 Exploring New Cultures</h3>
	<p>
Whether it's studying abroad, learning a new language, or diving into cultural traditions, I’m all about broadening my horizons. My recent trip to Denmark reflects my love for global experiences, and I’m always eager to discover more about the world.

	<h3>🎢 Thrills and Adventures</h3>
	<p>
At 21, I took a leap of faith with my first parachute jump, and it changed everything. That experience ignited my passion for extreme sports. It’s not just about the adrenaline, it’s about the thrill of breaking boundaries, overcoming fear, and fully embracing the intensity of the moment.

	<h3>🐾 Caring for Animals</h3>
	<p>
Growing up surrounded by dogs and my beloved cat, I developed a lifelong connection with animals. They’ve always been a source of comfort, joy, and companionship. Since moving away from home, I’ve found a way to keep that bond alive by offering pet-sitting services. It’s incredibly rewarding to care for animals, ensuring they’re happy and comfortable while their owners are away.
